## Understanding License Types

### License Usage

Single-site license keys can also be used for staging sites. The following subdomains/locations will NOT count against your license limit:

- localhost
- 10.0.0.0/8
- 172.16.0.0/12
- 192.168.0.0/16
- *.dev
- .*local
- dev.*
- staging.*

This means you can use your license on:
- Your live site (example.com)
- Your staging site (staging.example.com)
- Your local development (localhost)
- Development subdomain (dev.example.com)

### Multiple Sites?
- Each site needs its own license
- Consider bulk licensing deals
- Contact support for agency rates

## Activation Troubleshooting

### "Invalid Purchase Code" Error

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Typo in code** - Check for spaces or missing characters
2. **Wrong code** - Ensure it's Reign theme code, not another product
3. **Already used** - Code may be active on another site

**Solutions:**
- Double-check code from source
- Remove any spaces before/after code
- Deactivate from old site first
- Contact support if code seems correct

### "Connection Error" Message

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Firewall blocking** - Server security too strict
2. **SSL issues** - HTTPS certificate problems
3. **Server timeout** - Slow connection to license server

**Solutions:**
```php
// Add to wp-config.php for testing
define('WP_HTTP_BLOCK_EXTERNAL', false);
```
- Contact hosting to whitelist wbcomdesigns.com
- Try activation at different time
- Use alternative activation method (contact support)

### "License Already Active" Error

This means your code is registered to another domain.

**To Transfer License:**
1. **Deactivate from Old Site**
   - Log into old site's WordPress admin
   - Go to Appearance ‚Üí Reign Settings ‚Üí License
   - Click "Deactivate License"

2. **Activate on New Site**
